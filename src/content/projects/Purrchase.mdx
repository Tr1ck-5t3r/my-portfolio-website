# TL;DR

**Purrchase** is a full-stack MERN application built to connect users with lovable pets for adoption.  
It features user authentication, pet browsing, wishlists, payments via Razorpay, and an admin dashboard for pet and order management.

# Introduction

Purrchase makes it easy for users to browse adoptable pets, manage their profiles, and complete secure adoptions through Razorpay.  
The application is built with **React + Redux** on the frontend and **Node.js + Express** on the backend, with **MongoDB** handling data persistence.  
Admins can also manage pets, users, and orders via a simple CMS-like interface.

# 🧠 Why Purrchase?

Many lovable pets often go unnoticed due to the lack of proper adoption platforms.  
Purrchase was built to bridge this gap — offering a seamless experience for users to explore, wishlist, and adopt pets, while also giving adoption centers an easy-to-use dashboard to manage listings, orders, and users.
